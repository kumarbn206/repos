# RFE SW ATB ES1 DOCS folder structure
This folder is intended to contain those documents related to the implementation of RFE ATB driver for ES1.


Apart from the root directory, the following sections briefly details the content of each folder for the ATB ES1 docs

## ATB config examples
Folder containing diverse examples of how to use ATB RFE driver in `.md` format 

## atbADCsCalibration
Folder containing Matlab scripts to post process the ATB ADC measurements depending on whether it ws use Mono/Continous measurments. 

## atbADCsTrimming
Folder containing Matlab scripts to convert OTP trimming values into the adecuate values. The algorithm there described is implemented in the trimming of ATB ADC.

## Auxiliary Doc
Folder containing old designs of ATB at the beginning of STRX project. It also contains the requirements coming from DOORS used to devise ATB SW unit.

## EA-SW-Unit-DD
Folder containing the EA backs up of the ATB DD

## HW Docs
Folder containing Analog and Digital documentantion for ES1 needed to understand how ATB HW works.
Important to mention is  `amos_c028hpcp_ad10b5m_data_sheet.pdf` which is the datasheet for ATB ADC.

## RegisterMaps
Folder containing the register map from ES1 to implement ATB SW unit.
