In this document we will list the waved compiler warnings

 1. -Wno-parentheses-equality

 2. -Wno-unknown-pragmas
      NOTE: Only waved for pragma's:   #pragma __scanf_args  #pragma __printf_args


=====================================================================================================================

1. Equality comparison with extraneous parentheses [-Wparentheses-equality]
    ( 'remove extraneous parentheses around the comparison to silence this warning' )
   
    Warnings like these warnings can be generated by for instance Macro's calling other Macro's.
    The coding standards requires parenthesis to prevent the wrong interpretations.
    Extraneous Parentheses (around parenthesis) will not lead to wrong results
    Extraneous Parentheses (around parenthesis) may lead to wrong suggestions by the compiler.
    Extraneous Parentheses (around parenthesis) may result in important warnings to be missed.

   Removinge this warning will have no impact on the quality of the software. 
   The alternative, forbidding the use of Macro's calling Macro's is not practical at this stage.

2. Unknown pragma's  [ -Wunknown-pragmas ]
   We are using some specific pragma's : #pragma __scanf_args and #pragma __printf_args
   These will generate loads of warnnings, cluttering other more important warnings.
   By only waving the warnings for the pragma's mentioned removing these warnings will have no 
   impact on the quality of the software.
